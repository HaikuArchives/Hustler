Released on Tuesday, 28 March 2000

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">What is it</FONT></I><BR>
Hustler is a simple audio player for BeOS R4.5 or higher that runs inside 
the Deskbar. It uses add-ons to do the actual playing, so what kinds of audio
are supported depends on the add-ons that you have installed. The
standard distribution comes with a CDDA player add-on and an experimental
SoundPlay remote control add-on.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">How to install it</FONT></I><BR>
Double-click the Installer icon to launch the installation program. The
Installer will automatically put Hustler in the
<FONT COLOR="#885522"><CODE>"/boot/home/config/bin/"</CODE></FONT> folder
and the add-ons in the
<FONT COLOR="#885522"><CODE>"/boot/home/config/add-ons/Hustler/"</CODE></FONT> 
folder. If you wish, the Installer will also modify your boot script to 
launch Hustler every time you start your computer.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">How to get rid of it</FONT></I><BR>
Double-click the Uninstaller icon to launch the uninstallation program. The
Uninstaller will automatically remove Hustler and its add-ons from your 
system and your boot script.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">How to write add-ons</FONT></I><BR>
If you're a developer who wishes to create a add-on for Hustler (in which
case you probably have way too much spare time ;-), you may want to read the
<A HREF="Source/API Documentation.html">Hustler add-on API documentation</A>.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Known problems</FONT></I><BR>
Because of problems with the CD driver that ships with the BeOS, I have not 
been able to implement some features in the CDDA add-on, such as stopping a 
CD or skipping through tracks. 

<P>It may take a few seconds for the CDDA add-on to recognize a CD that 
contains a data track if you have enabled automatic disk mounting in the BeOS
Disk Mount Settings menu.

<P>The SoundPlay remote control add-on is very limited, and may cause
SoundPlay to hang from time to time.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Legal stuff</FONT></I><BR>
Hustler is public domain, so you may do anything you like with it.
No warranties expressed or implied. I am not responsible for whatever may 
happen to whomever, whenever. 

<P>The CDDA add-on contains software components developed by Peter Urbanec
and Be, Inc. The Installer and Uninstaller are based on a script originally 
written by Tyler Riti. Thanks guys!

Version 1.0 (Saturday, 20 March 1999) 
<UL> 
<LI>First version. 
</UL> 

Version 2.0 (Saturday, 21 August 1999)
<UL>
<LI>Hustler is no longer limited to just playing CDs; it now uses add-ons to
deal with an unlimited variety of players.
<LI>Added the "volume" and "panning" menu items.
<LI>On start-up, Hustler automatically activates the player that you selected
most recently.
</UL>

Version 2.1 (Saturday, 25 September 1999)
<UL>
<LI>Fixed an error in the makefiles of the add-ons that prevented them from
compiling correctly under BeOS R4.5.2.
<LI>The Installer script now correctly cleans up when some error occurs.
<LI>Hustler doesn't hang anymore if something goes wrong with the SoundPlay
remote control add-on.
</UL>

Version 2.2 (Tuesday, 28 March 2000)
<UL>
<LI>New release for BeOS R5. Older versions of Hustler came with source
code only, which was automatically compiled during installation. However,
because of header file changes between R5 and older versions of the BeOS, 
and because the free version of BeOS R5 doesn't necessarily include 
development tools, Hustler 2.2 is already compiled. This means that it
only runs on the Intel platform, since I don't have a PowerPC machine.
